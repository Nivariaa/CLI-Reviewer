This is a simple Python program that I wrote to help me review for terms in exams when no one was around to help me.

It uses "items.txt" to save items that are manually entered by the user.

It has a review mode that shows a random item definition from the txt file, and then after the user guessed the item name, he can press enter to reveal the answer. The process repeats for all of the remaining items in the txt file which are randomly shuffled.

The program also has an exam mode which shows a random item name as a question and 4 random choices which are definitions from the other items (including the definition of the randomized question). Just like the review mode, the process repeats for all of the remaining items in the txt file which are also randomly shuffled.
